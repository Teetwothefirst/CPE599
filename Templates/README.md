Basic Pseudocode

I want to add a script file to store my javascript code in it 
Then in the html link it to the javascript
Then the reason for adding the javascript file is to allow a trigger function;
    So when I click on the On button it should do something
    When I click on the off button it should do something 
    that something for now should just either print a message or change the button name or trigger an event
        So first I would work on changing the button name;
            ? How do I do that, Okay I've created my id selector,create a javascript function to trigger the click event, the the result should change from off - turn off
